### Hello!

Mehluli Hikwa is a digital experience designer with a passion for using technology to leapfrog human/user problems and create magical experiences. racterized by empathy and a focus on delivering exceptional user experiences. When I take on a project, I simply don't ask you what you would like and then deliver that. I dig deeper and try to discover what will make your project successful so I can then develop functional solutions around those discoveries.
