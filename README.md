### Hello!

My name is Mehluli Hikwa - I'm a multifaceted designer with a passion for using technology to leapfrog human/user problems and create magical experiences. When I take on a project, I simply don't ask you what you would like and then deliver that. I dig deeper and try to discover what will make your project successful so I can then develop functional solutions around those discoveries.
